# League Of Legends Randomizer Rune Page
How to use it.

Just run the start.bat file and it should give you a rune page randomizer. If it doesnt and gives you some sort of error, make sure you have downloaded at node.js version 12.18.1 or higher (https://nodejs.org/en/)

Note this was made during season 10. Rune pages may change in the future and if it does then this may be irrelevant to you.
There is also a small chance your second rune slot 1 and 2 may be picked from the same row and if it happens just use the first one and then you can either choose yourself or rerun it until you get another one for slot 2. Also this includes all champions made in season 10, August 1st 2020 or before. Any champion made after that date may not be included! If you want to make sure its all include just go to the repl.it to check that was it mostly updated to the lastest.

To start make sure you have an open shell and not in node. The way to check this is normally the shell will have nothing and node shell with have node (version) at the start of it. To open a shell press F1 and they type Open Shell and then it should open a shell below the node shell. Once in their just run this command 'npm run start' and you will be good to go.
