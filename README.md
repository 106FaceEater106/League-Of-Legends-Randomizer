How to use it.

Repl.it:
Press the green arrow it should work if you on the post site else it should auto run on website.

Just run the start.bat file and it should give you a rune page randomizer. If it doesnt and gives you some sort of error, make sure you have downloaded at node.js version 12.18.1 or higher (https://nodejs.org/en/)

There is also a small chance your second rune slot 1 and 2 may be picked from the same row and if it happens just use the first one and then you can either choose yourself or rerun it until you get another one for slot 2.
